Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/3.6-risk-20250130.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/3.6-nfr-20250130.md

### Recommended Status

âš  **Changes Required - See unchecked items above** - The core functionality is excellent and demonstrates professional-grade development, but 3 acceptance criteria need completion to fully meet the story requirements. The service layer is already implemented, so only the UI components need to be completed.

### Detailed Implementation Analysis

**Strengths:**
- **Architecture Excellence:** Clean separation of concerns with dedicated service layer, context providers, and reusable components
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures and form handling
- **User Experience:** Intuitive tabbed interface with clear navigation, responsive design, and accessibility features
- **Data Management:** Sophisticated service layer with localStorage persistence, validation, and error handling
- **Component Quality:** Well-structured React components with proper prop interfaces, error states, and loading states
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage for main dashboard component with proper mocking

**Areas for Completion:**
- **Data Export/Import:** Service layer has full export functionality (CSV/JSON), but UI needs implementation
- **Integration Management:** Service layer has integration settings, but UI needs implementation  
- **Privacy and Security:** Service layer has privacy settings, but UI needs implementation

**Technical Debt Assessment:**
- **None identified** - The codebase demonstrates excellent architecture and follows best practices
- **Service layer is production-ready** with comprehensive functionality and validation
- **UI components are well-designed** and ready for the remaining feature implementations

The implementation demonstrates professional-grade frontend development skills and is ready for production use once the remaining UI components are completed.
