## Executive Summary

### Goals

- **Dashboard Simplicity:** Create a single, simple interface that replaces checking 5+ different business tools
- **Automation ROI Visibility:** Show business owners the impact and value of their automation investments
- **Daily Business Health Check:** Provide daily aggregated metrics for confident, data-driven decision making
- **Time Savings:** Reduce daily data review from 2-3 hours to 30 minutes (75% reduction)
- **Market Validation:** Achieve 10 paying customers at $99/month within 3 months
- **Technical Feasibility:** Build MVP with Google Analytics + n8n integration in 8-9 weeks

### Background Context

The Dynamic KPI Dashboard System addresses a critical gap in the small business automation market. While businesses are rapidly adopting automation tools like n8n, they lack visibility into whether these investments are actually driving business value. Existing dashboard solutions (Klipfolio, Databox) are enterprise-focused and too complex for small business needs, leaving a market gap for simple, automation-focused business intelligence.

The system solves the "information correlation problem" - small business owners currently spend 2-3 hours daily checking multiple platforms (Google Analytics, Meta Business Suite, CRM, email platforms, automation tools) without seeing the connections between them. Our solution acts as a "Backend to Frontend Translator," making invisible automation work visible and valuable through daily aggregated metrics that focus on business insights rather than technical complexity.
