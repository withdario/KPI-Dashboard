# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The dashboard should feel like a "daily business health check" - simple, clean, and immediately actionable. Business owners should be able to answer "How is my business performing?" and "Are my automations working?" in under 30 seconds. The interface should prioritize clarity over complexity, with large, easy-to-read metrics and simple charts that tell a story rather than overwhelming with data.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Glance-and-Go:** Critical metrics visible at first glance without scrolling
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Detailed information available on demand but not cluttering the main view
- **Contextual Actions:** Quick actions (like "View Details" or "Export Report") appear where relevant
- **Mobile-First Responsive:** Optimized for business owners checking metrics on phones/tablets throughout the day

## Core Screens and Views

1. **Login Screen** - Simple authentication with business branding
2. **Main Dashboard** - Overview of all key metrics with large, clear numbers
3. **Metrics Detail View** - Expanded view of specific metric with historical trends
4. **Automation Performance** - Dedicated section showing n8n workflow status and ROI
5. **Settings Page** - Integration management and user preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

- **Rationale:** Small business owners may have varying technical comfort levels, and WCAG AA ensures the dashboard is accessible to users with different abilities while maintaining reasonable development complexity

## Branding

- **Professional but Approachable:** Clean, modern design that feels trustworthy for business decisions
- **Color Psychology:** Use blues and greens for trust and growth, avoid overwhelming reds
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts that work well on all devices
- **Iconography:** Simple, intuitive icons that don't require technical knowledge
