## Review Schedule

- **Next Review:** 2025-02-13
- **NFR Reassessment:** After implementation of P0 and P1 items
- **Production Readiness Review:** After all critical NFR issues are resolved

## Notes

The frontend optimization system represents excellent technical implementation with sophisticated algorithms and proper architectural patterns. The primary NFR concerns stem from missing testing coverage and incomplete feature implementation rather than fundamental design issues. With proper test coverage and completion of missing components, this story has the potential to achieve high NFR compliance and production readiness.

The architecture demonstrates strong maintainability and security practices, which provides a solid foundation for addressing the identified gaps.
