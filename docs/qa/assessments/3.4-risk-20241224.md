- **Residual Risk:** Minimal - performance optimizations implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor performance with real data volumes
- Consider performance testing for large datasets

### 5. Maintainability Risk: LOW (2/10)

**Risk Description:** Code that is difficult to maintain and extend.

**Current Status:** ✅ **MITIGATED**
- **Evidence:** Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **Mitigation:** Well-structured components and TypeScript interfaces
- **Residual Risk:** Minimal - excellent code organization

**Recommendations:**
- Continue current architectural patterns
- Document any complex business logic for future developers

## Risk Mitigation Summary

| Mitigation Status | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| ✅ **Mitigated** | 5 | 100% |
| ⚠️ **Partially Mitigated** | 0 | 0% |
| ❌ **Not Mitigated** | 0 | 0% |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (None Required)
- No immediate actions needed - all risks are adequately mitigated

### Short-term Actions (Next 2 weeks)
- Monitor component performance with real data
- Validate test coverage with additional edge cases

### Long-term Actions (Next quarter)
- Consider performance monitoring for large datasets
- Evaluate accessibility testing tools
