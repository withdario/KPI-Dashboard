## Executive Summary

### Architecture Overview

The Dynamic KPI Dashboard System is designed as a **monolithic, API-first web application** with a clear separation of concerns between data collection, processing, and presentation layers. The system follows a **three-tier architecture** pattern optimized for small business SaaS requirements with future multi-tenant expansion capabilities.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Monorepo Structure:** Single repository for frontend, backend, and shared components
- **Monolithic Backend:** Express.js API server with modular service architecture
- **React Frontend:** Component-based UI with Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Relational database with row-level security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Containerized application with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Daily Batch Processing:** Scheduled data synchronization to maintain simplicity

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Chart.js
- **Backend:** Node.js 20 + Express.js + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 + Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Kubernetes + AWS/Google Cloud
- **Monitoring:** Winston logging + Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
